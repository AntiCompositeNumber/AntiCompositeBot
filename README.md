# ShouldBeSVG
Wikimedia Commons contains a lot of medium and low quality raster charts, diagrams, and other images that would be better displayed using vector graphics. To indicate this, editors can apply {{[Convert to SVG](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template:Convert_to_SVG)}} to the file description page to categorize the file in [Category:Images that should use vector graphics](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images_that_should_use_vector_graphics). Some of the files in that category are used in dozens of places while others aren't at all. This task generates a series of reports that sort various Convert to SVG categories by global usage.

This task was previously performed by [User:McTopot](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:McTopot).

This project, including this documentation, is licensed under Apache 2.0. The code is available on [https://github.com/AntiCompositeNumber/AntiCompositeBot GitHub].

## Reports
All times are UTC. The time indicated is the start time. Reports can take some time to run and are affected by load on the Toolforge grid. If a report has not run for two weeks, contact me on [my talk page](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User_talk:AntiCompositeNumber) or file an issue.

## Configuration
* To prevent the bot from editing or analyzing pages, change [User:AntiCompositeBot/ShouldBeSVG/Run](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:AntiCompositeBot/ShouldBeSVG/Run) to False. If you do this, please leave a message on [User:AntiCompositeNumber|my talk page](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:AntiCompositeNumber|my talk page) explaining why. 
* The main configuration for ShouldBeSVG is stored at [User:AntiCompositeBot/ShouldBeSVG/reports.json](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:AntiCompositeBot/ShouldBeSVG/reports.json). Changing this file will affect what reports are available to the bot and what pages are affected. 
* The configuration for what report will be run at what time is stored in the code of [ShouldBeSVG-helper.py](https://github.com/AntiCompositeNumber/AntiCompositeBot/blob/master/ShouldBeSVG-helper.py). If there is no entry for a report in this file, the bot will not run the report.
* The format of a report gallery is dependent on ShouldBeSVG.py. Additional information, categories, etc. should be placed above the comment line on the report gallery or it will be overwritten on the next run.

## Running the bot
The bot runs three times a day from Toolforge. A cron job runs ShouldBeSVG-helper.py which determines which report should be run at that time. The helper then submits a job to the grid for that report. The cron entry is set for 02:11, 10:11, and 18:11 UTC in an attempt to avoid the high-load hourly and daily times. Only one report can be run at a time right now.

To run the bot manually, find the key for the report in the table above or in the configuration. Then run `ShouldBeSVG.py <key>` directly. Adding `--simulate` will print the output gallery to SDOUT instead of saving it.
